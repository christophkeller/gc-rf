Fortran routines that can be used to run the random forest within GEOS-Chem.
It should be noted that this is a very crude implementation that is not faster 
than the actual chemical integrator!

chml_mod.F90 is the main module. It defines the random forest and makes the predictions.
The location for the ascii files with all random forest information (created by rf_train.py)
is currently hardcoded at the beginnig of this module.

chemistry_mod.F is the modified GEOS-Chem routine containing the hooks to chml_mod.F90. 
The hardcoded parameter DoRF can be used to switch the random forest emulator on/off.
In addition to the calls to the random forest model there is also code to generate all
data necessary for ML training. These data are filled into the public arrays defined at
the beginning of the module. If run as part of an offline CTM, these arrays need to be 
manually output to bpch or netCDF format.
